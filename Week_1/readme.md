Learning Objectives

---

* Gain understanding about Kerasâ€™ utilities for pre-processing image data, in particular the ImageDataGenerator class
* Develop helper functions to move files around the filesystem so that they can be fed to the ImageDataGenerator
* Learn how to plot training and validation accuracies to evaluate model performance
* Build a classifier using convolutional neural networks for performing cats vs dogs classification
